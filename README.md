# Online Banking System
The online banking interface is primarily designed for online banking for balance inquiry, depositing cash, cash withdrawal, online transfer, and password change.
## Purpose
The typical way to retain the data of a customer in a bank was to enter and register the details. Any time a consumer has to make any transactions, he must go to the bank and take the required steps, which might not be possible all the time. The project offers a real life understanding of the online banking environment.
